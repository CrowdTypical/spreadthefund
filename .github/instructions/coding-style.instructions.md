# Coding Style — Universal Principles

These principles apply to all code in every project regardless of language or framework.

---

## 1. Never Nester

Flat code is readable code. This is the foundational structural rule.

| Depth | Status | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 0–2 | **Target** | Where most code should live |
| 3 | **Exception** | Acceptable for specific, justified cases |
| 4 | **Hard limit** | Never exceed — refactor before proceeding |

### Techniques to Stay Flat

**Guard clauses / early returns:**
```dart
// ❌ Nested
Future<Result> handleRequest(Request request) async {
  if (request.isValid) {
    if (request.isAuthorized) {
      return await process(request);
    }
    return Result.unauthorized();
  }
  return Result.invalid();
}

// ✅ Guard clauses — happy path at lowest indentation
Future<Result> handleRequest(Request request) async {
  if (!request.isValid) return Result.invalid();
  if (!request.isAuthorized) return Result.unauthorized();
  return await process(request);
}
```

**Continue in loops:**
```dart
// ❌ Wrapped loop body
for (final item in items) {
  if (item.isActive) {
    if (item.isValid) {
      process(item);
    }
  }
}

// ✅ Skip early
for (final item in items) {
  if (!item.isActive || !item.isValid) continue;
  process(item);
}
```

**Extract to functions** when nesting grows:
```dart
// ❌ Deeply nested
for (final zone in zones) {
  for (final record in zone.records) {
    if (record.needsUpdate) {
      try {
        await update(record); // Level 4 — too deep
      } catch (e) {
        throw UpdateException('Failed: $e');
      }
    }
  }
}

// ✅ Extracted
for (final zone in zones) {
  await reconcileZone(zone);
}

Future<void> reconcileZone(Zone zone) async {
  for (final record in zone.records) {
    if (!record.needsUpdate) continue;
    await update(record);
  }
}
```

---

## 2. Single Responsibility

A function does one thing. If you need the word "and" to describe it, split it.

- Aim for functions under ~40 lines — a smell threshold, not a hard rule
- Name functions as verbs: `validateInput()`, `buildResponse()`, `saveConfig()`
- If a function is hard to name, it's probably doing too much

---

## 3. Fail Fast, Fail Loud

- Validate inputs at the boundary (function entry, API handler, user input)
- Return errors immediately — don't accumulate invalid state
- Never silently swallow errors unless explicitly justified with a comment
- Prefer specific error handling over bare catch-all blocks

```dart
// ❌ Silent swallow
try {
  await saveData(item);
} catch (e) {
  // do nothing
}

// ✅ Handle or re-throw with context
try {
  await saveData(item);
} on FirebaseException catch (e) {
  throw DataException('Failed to save "${item.title}": ${e.message}');
}
```

---

## 4. Naming Is Design

Good names eliminate the need for most comments.

| Element | Convention | Examples |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Variables | Descriptive at distance, short at proximity | `i` in a 3-line loop; `userAccount` across 20 lines |
| Functions | Verb phrases | `getRecord()`, `validateConfig()`, `buildResponse()` |
| Booleans | Read as questions | `isValid`, `hasPermission`, `canRetry` |
| Constants | Describe meaning, not value | `maxRetries` not `three` |
| Classes/Types | Nouns or noun phrases | `UserRepository`, `DebtItem`, `PaymentResult` |

**Abbreviations:** Only universally understood ones — `ctx`, `err`, `req`, `res`, `db`.
When in doubt, spell it out.

---

## 5. Comments Explain Why, Not What

- Code tells you *what*. Comments tell you *why*.
- Every workaround gets a comment explaining what it works around
- **TODO format:** `// TODO(#issue): description`
- **Delete commented-out code** — git history preserves everything

```dart
// ❌ Explains what (the code already says this)
// Increment counter by one
counter++;

// ✅ Explains why (context the code can't convey)
// Delay between API calls — Firebase rate-limits above 60 req/min
await Future.delayed(rateLimitDelay);
```

---

## 6. DRY but Not Premature

- **Rule of Three:** Don't abstract until you've seen the pattern three times
- Duplication is cheaper than the wrong abstraction
- When abstracting, the shared code must represent the *same concept*, not just similar text

---

## 7. Explicit Over Implicit

- Don't rely on default behavior unless it's well-documented
- Explicit null checks, explicit type conversions, explicit default values
- No magic numbers — use named constants

```dart
// ❌ Magic number
if (retries > 3) { ... }

// ✅ Named constant
const maxRetries = 3;
if (retries > maxRetries) { ... }
```

---

## 8. Consistent Error Handling

Wrap errors with context about *what was being attempted*:

```dart
try {
  final result = await fetchRecord(name);
} on IOException catch (e) {
  throw RecordFetchException('Failed to fetch record "$name"', e);
}
```

```typescript
try {
  const result = await fetchRecord(name);
} catch (error) {
  throw new Error(`Failed to fetch record '${name}': ${error.message}`);
}
```

- Never bare `catch (e)` without re-throwing or explicit justification
- Log errors at the point where you have the most context

---

## 9. State Management

- Minimize mutable state — prefer transforming data through functions
- Keep state close to where it's used
- No global mutable variables
- In UI code: single source of truth, unidirectional data flow

---

## 10. Code Layout / Reading Order

A reader should understand a file top-to-bottom without jumping.

1. Imports / package declaration
2. Constants and type definitions
3. Public / exported functions or classes (entry points near top)
4. Private / internal functions

Organize by **logical grouping**, not alphabetically.

---

## 11. Performance Philosophy

**No premature optimization.** Follow the ladder:

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Notice a real, measurable problem |
| 2 | Measure it with profilers/timing |
| 3 | Check data structures first (biggest lever) |
| 4 | Profile for hotspots |
| 5 | Look under the hood (last resort) |

Write clear code first. Correct and readable beats fast and clever.

---

## 12. Anti-Patterns Summary

| ❌ Avoid | ✅ Prefer |
|----------|-----------|
| Deep nesting (4+ levels) | Guard clauses, extraction, early returns |
| Functions that do multiple things | Single-purpose functions composed together |
| Silent error swallowing | Explicit handling or justified suppression |
| Clever one-liners | Clear multi-line code humans read easily |
| Magic numbers and strings | Named constants |
| Commented-out code blocks | Delete it — git remembers |
| `dynamic` / `any` escape hatches | Proper types, even if verbose |
| Copy-pasting on first duplication | Accept duplication until the pattern is clear |
| Optimizing without measuring | Follow the performance ladder |
| Abbreviations only you understand | Spell it out |

---

## 13. Testing Philosophy

**No testing theater.** Every test should exist for a reason.

| Test It | Why |
|---------|-----|
| Functions with branching logic | Multiple paths = multiple ways to break |
| Core business logic | If this breaks, everything breaks |
| Edge cases (empty input, null, max values) | Off-by-one and boundary bugs are common |
| Code likely to be refactored | Tests are your safety net |
| Anything that's bitten you before | Regression tests prevent repeat pain |

| Skip It | Why |
|---------|-----|
| Simple getters with no logic | Testing the language, not your code |
| Thin wrappers around libraries | Test your logic, not theirs |
